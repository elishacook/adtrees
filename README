This is two implementations of ADTrees ("All Dimensions" not "Alternating Decision") 
in python and C++. They are functionally almost the same and based on the original 
paper found here: http://www.autonlab.org/autonweb/14687

This is mainly an experimental project that will look at other optimizations for
ADTrees particularly with respect to large data sets.
